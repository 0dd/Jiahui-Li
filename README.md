## Report Academic Fraud 
Dear Admissions Committee,

I would like to report an academic fraud of an admitted class 2021 undergraduate students in GS Columbia. He is Jiahui Li (李嘉晖) from China. He is known to conceal and forge his experience on his application’s material. These disclosure receives a substantive response in Chinese network.(https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/42409706)  (https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/42424831)

I knew that GS school offers opportunities for "those students with a break of a year or more in their educational paths." However, Li conceals his undergraduate experience in Sino-German College of Technology, East China University of Science and Technology, after his graduation from high school and make up his gap year experience. The paper in 2016 he published was also supported by this university, which could be found in https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/cssc.201601617. The proof was also given by the school’s register office which could be found in [Figure 1](https://github.com/0dd/Jiahui-Li/blob/master/Figure%201.jpg).

It is also reported by his cohorts in East China University of Science and Technology that he had failed in several courses and did not submit his undergraduate’s transcript to GS admissions office trying to cover his undergraduate experience. He even failed in several courses which make him a 68 GPA in 100 scale in the first year in East China University of Science and Technology. The transcript was disclosure by the school’s academic office which could be found in [Figure2](https://github.com/0dd/Jiahui-Li/blob/master/Figure%202.jpg).

Besides, he also has academic misconduct issues, including fraudulent CV in researchgate and public Linkedin page, which could be found in Figure [3](https://github.com/0dd/Jiahui-Li/blob/master/Figure%203%20.png)&[4](https://github.com/0dd/Jiahui-Li/blob/master/Figure%204.png).

1. He made up his research experience from **Aug 2016-Jan 2017** in Chinese Academy of Sciences · Nobel Laureate Professor Bernard Feringa Joint Research Center (Figure 4), which was established on **October 22**, 2017(https://www.ecust.edu.cn/_t53/2017/1129/c841a71307/page.htm).
2. He made up his research experience from Sep 2013–Jun 2015 in **Fudan University** · State Key Laboratory of Surface Physics.  — The two papers issued in this period was supported by **No. 2 Secondary School**
Attached to East China Normal University. Which could be found in https://as-botanicalstudies.springeropen.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40529-014-0047-5 and https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268814562_Preparation_and_properties_of_novel_building_materials_at_low_temperature

The papers he presented are also facing plagiarism and data fraud. The more details information was explained in following pages (https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/42409706)   (https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/42424831).

Please give his application material a review and reconsider his admission. The admission you give to people like him is a direct harm to those who want to apply GS.

I would appreciate your attention to this matter.

Best regards,
